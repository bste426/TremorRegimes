featbatch.py has 3 functions: (1) downloading miniseed earthquake data, (2) converting miniseed files to continuous time stream (csv), and (3) generating feature matrices to use as SOM input.

_init_.py is an accompaying file support featbatch.py. Both codes need to be executed within the correct conda envrionment (environment.yml).
