# SOM classification

sombatchheat.py uses feature matrices to classify seismic time windows. Settings can be chosen as needed in the top of the code. The corresponding conda environment is required to run this code.

matrixcorr.py is a tool to catch erroneous data windows within the matrices (e.g. caused by extreme interpolation or faulty recordings by the station).
